# üçΩÔ∏è Food Delivery Website (React Project)

This is my **first React project**, a food ordering web application that mimics the user interface of platforms like Swiggy. It allows users to browse restaurants, view their menus, search and filter restaurants, and manage their cart using Redux.

> üí° **Note**: This project is built purely for learning and educational purposes. No commercial use or real API access is intended.
